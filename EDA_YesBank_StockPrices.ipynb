    "1. **Most Frequent Opening Prices (Left-Skewed Distribution):**\n",

    "    - A majority of the opening prices are **below ₹50**, with high frequency in the **₹0-50 range**.\n",

    "2. **Lower Occurrence of High Prices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The frequency of opening prices **above ₹150** is significantly lower, meaning the stock had fewer instances of high valuations.\n",

    "    - Another smaller peak in the **₹250-350 range**, corresponding to the high-growth period (2017-2018).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Market Sentiment & Volatility:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The presence of a long tail on the right suggests that high stock prices were less frequent and unsustainable.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - The data points form a diagonal pattern, indicating a strong correlation between the opening and closing prices.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - At higher price levels (above ₹200), there is more spread in data points, meaning greater intraday fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Tighter Clustering at Lower Price Levels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The lower price range (₹0-100) shows a compact distribution, meaning the stock had less price movement during its lower valuation periods.\n",
